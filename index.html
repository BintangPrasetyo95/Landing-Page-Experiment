                skills that allows her to disrupt the enemy front. Ruby can be played either as Fighter or a Roaming
                Tank and can easily distrupt enemy skills such as Odette Odette and Pharsa Pharsa. She is also one of
                the most annoying Crowd Control hero in Mobile Legends due to her multi-stuns and her massive Spell
